            Hi! I'm Julia (but most people call me Julie).
        <br>I'm a student from Germany, studying Games & Immersive Media at Hochschule Furtwangen University.
        <br>In my own game projects, I place a strong emphasis on narrative, as I've been writing stories for over three quarters of my life â€” even before I could write, I asked my grandma to be my pen.
        <br>Currently, I'm in my first semester and working on an unannounced personal project.
        </p>
